let's say u have written some code in terraform in (main.tf) file assume that we are creating S3 bucket in AWS

**statefile** is a brain of terraform which stores all records of a file i.e creation of s3 buckets. 
This file is important bcz when some executes apply again it will thro error or give info that it already executed.
It stores all complete information about resources. if u update or delete the  main.tf , all track will be stored in statefile.

## **What is a Terraform Statefile?**
- Terraform maintains a statefile (`terraform.tfstate`) that records information about managed infrastructure.
- It acts as the single source of truth for Terraform and helps track resource mappings between Terraform configurations and real-world infrastructure.

## **Why is the Statefile Important?**
- **Tracking Resources:** Terraform uses the statefile to understand which resources it manages.
- **Performance Optimization:** Instead of querying cloud providers every time, Terraform reads from the statefile to improve performance.
- **Dependency Management:** It helps Terraform determine resource dependencies and execution order.



# **Why statefile management is very important?**

**Problem statement:** Suppose **'A'** devops engineer wrote main.tf, within that **'A'** is creating ec2 and s3 by using terraform commands as init, plan and apply. once commands is done the result is that it created ec2 and s3 on AWS console of an organisation. Terraform updated the statefile to remember the track that it has created resources(ec2, s3).

Now **'B'** devops user downloaded the code from git repository and updated the main.tf . when **'B'** user runs the commands init and plan are succesful when it comes to apply command , it is again creating a resources(ec2, s3) . 

When **'B'** looks into aws account it has already created resources are displayed. The problem here is statefile acts  as local to the machine in **'A'** user so that **'B'** user will not get any warnings or messages and it creates new resources.

Statefile is very sensitive which can have NAT gateway, ip address etc information which is not masked i.e secrets are open . if we push the statefile in git repo ,it is public where secrets are leaked, it becomes sensitive

## To manage the statefile we use

**Backend(remote)**
**statelocking**


# **Remote Backend**(s3)

**'A'** user creates or configures the remote backend/ backend.tf file. The statefile is now stored in remote backend which in AWS is new s3 bucket. where this backend.tf file is updated in git repo.

Now, **'B'** user clones the git repo and if anything he updates now it will not creates new resources it just updates the resources.


# **statelocking**(Dynamo db)

Suppose you have terraform code in git repo , there is a chance of cloning the same repo by 2 users at a time, and update something . both of them are trying to "apply" at same time , where both of them are making API calls. Now it will become confusion which update should be picked , in this case **Locking mechanism** evolved.

**'A'** user locks the statefile and appy the command to create resources. if **'B'** user is applied at same time now he sees a message that statefile has been locked and he waits for a while until statefile has released.
