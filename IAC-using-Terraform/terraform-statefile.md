let's say u have written some code in terraform in (main.tf) file assume that we are creating S3 bucket in AWS

**statefile** is a brain of terraform which stores all records of a file i.e creation of s3 buckets. 
This file is important bcz when some executes apply again it will thro error or give info that it already executed.
It stores all complete information about resources. if u update or delete the  main.tf , all track will be stored in statefile.

## **What is a Terraform Statefile?**
- Terraform maintains a statefile (`terraform.tfstate`) that records information about managed infrastructure.
- It acts as the single source of truth for Terraform and helps track resource mappings between Terraform configurations and real-world infrastructure.

## **Why is the Statefile Important?**
- **Tracking Resources:** Terraform uses the statefile to understand which resources it manages.
- **Performance Optimization:** Instead of querying cloud providers every time, Terraform reads from the statefile to improve performance.
- **Dependency Management:** It helps Terraform determine resource dependencies and execution order.
